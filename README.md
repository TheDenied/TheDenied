### Hi, Iâ€™m Dan aka @TheDenied

I code MC Bedrock plugins based off original ideas.

### I'm currently working on a set of plugins based on fantasy RPG game mechanics:
- MagickMP
- MovementMP
- TamesMP

I'm generally interested in game mechanics rather then focusing on networking and data manamegemnt.
I've worked with PMMP for a long time now although I'm starting to shift to dragonfly.
